Some of my config files and scripts I find useful.

Configuration is now all managed by [home-manager](https://github.com/rycee/home-manager), so the
only configuration here is for that and for NixOS.


# Instructions

Create a directory with `hostname` as its name, including `home.nix` for home-manager and/or
`configuration.nix` for NixOs.

Then, run `./install.sh`.
